      Overwhelmed and stressed with little self-care, Lisa Mustard had her wake up call when she turned 40 years old. Tired of going through the motions of life with her lifestyle and career, she decided to pursue her passion of helping others bring optimal health, vitality, energy and happiness into their lives. Through her coaching, mentoring, and counseling, she’s here to teach you how to create a life you love with simplicity and ease. And when she’s not helping others transform their lives, she’s focusing on her supportive husband and two beautiful daughters who inspire her to live her best life every day.

      Lisa truly values creatively making a difference in the lives of others. Four years ago she joined a network marketing company and quickly fell in love with serving others, leading from the front, intentional personal growth and development and creating a legacy for her children. She is the first to tell you she fumbled for the first two years of growing her business. It wasn't until she started authentically and genuinely sharing her personal experiences with the products and business opportunity that her business grew. She realized that people joined those they know, like and trust and sought out mentors and coaches to help her build her brand, find her voice and expand her team. This app idea came about when people across team lines and companies started to ask her to help them with their personal branding and increasing engagement on their Facebook walls. Lisa knows time is money and saw how valuable her knowledge was so she brainstormed a way to help others while continuing to build her network marketing business. Lisa's goal is to help as many network marketers reach their goals – whether that's an extra $200 a month or a full time income that allows complete time and financial freedom!
